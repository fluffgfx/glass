# Glass

Glass is an in browser code editor written in react.

## What?

It's a fancy `<textarea>`.

Before:

```
<textarea />
```

After:

```
npm install --save react-glass
```

Because `glass` is taken by an abandoned attempt at what standardJS did better anyway.

```
// Arcane import black magic
<Glass language='javascript' />
```

And now, your `<textarea>` has syntax highlighting.

## How?

Glass wraps a textarea and makes the original element invisible, passing the value
through [prismjs](http://prismjs.com) and making it colorful. Yay!

## Why?

For the thrill of the journey, and the hangover of arrival. Or something like that.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

## Where?

Right here. Download minified releases in the "releases" tab, where one figures
releases would go.

For a live demo, visit [the website](https://glass.blvd.space). It ends in .space,
because my registrar was having a sale on the .space domain name.
